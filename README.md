# Matrix-Vector-Multiplication

## Blocked Matrix Vector Multiplication
Blocked multiplication is a lot slower. After running the code a few times I got values around this:
```
Regular: 1803921554 nanoseconds
Regular: 1.80392 seconds
Block Multiplication: 3579152105 nanoseconds
Block Multiplication: 3.57915 seconds
```
